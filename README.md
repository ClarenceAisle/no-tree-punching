This is a minecraft mod meant to add a little more believability to your first few minutes of minecraft play. A lot of the features are inspired by Terra Firma Craft for 1.7.10.  It adds a few new mechanics, a bit of world gen, and changes the way blocks are broken.

This wiki is directly ported from the in-game guidebook, provided by GuideAPI. The guidebook also includes crafting and furnace recipes for most items referenced in the book.

## Main Features

- Blocks broken without the correct tool will take longer and not drop anything
- Adds Flint tools of all kinds.
- Adds Saws, Mattocks and Knives, in both vanilla materials and config-enabled modded metals
- A few in-world and player crafting mechanics.
- Fire starter and a fire pit
- Loose rocks that are found on the surface.

### Compatibility Features

 - This mod has a guidebook. To use the guidebook, it requires [GuideAPI](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/guide-api)
 - JEI Support: All fire pit and knife recipes are recognized by JEI.
 - Craft Tweaker Support: Both the Fire pit and the Knife can have recipes added and removed via craft tweaker. Syntax can be found [here](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/Craft-Tweaker-Integration)
