This is a minecraft mod meant to add a little more believability to your first few minutes of minecraft play. It also adds the extra challenge that when you break a block with the wrong tool, it takes much longer to mine, and won't drop anything. Two new tools, Knives and Mattocks are added to help deal with this requirement. A lot of features are heavily inspired by the original TerraFirmaCraft for 1.7.10

Documentation for how to begin a new world can be found in JEI, under the information tab. All recipes and mechanics should be mentioned there.

## Getting Started

When starting a new world, there are a few tasks you will need to complete. Find and punch some gravel to get flint by a river or lake, pick up some rocks lying on the ground, and break leaves to get some sticks, and also find some exposed stone. This is all you will need to get started.

Start right clicking your flint on a piece of stone. Eventually it might break into flint shards, which you can use to craft a flint knife. Knives can be used for two main things: They can cut plant material for extra drops (Leaves drop more sticks, and long grass can drop plant fibers). They can also be used to cut items down. To cut an item, hold a knife in one hand and the item to be cut in the other, and then right click.

The first thing you will want to cut is some rocks, to make more flint shards. With sticks, flint, and some plant fibers you can now make a crude axe. Now you can gather some logs. To cut logs down into planks, or more sticks, you have to use your axe in the crafting grid.

With a crafting table you can make yourself a crude shovel and pickaxe, and prepare to go mining. Note that stone will break into smaller stone pieces, which you need to piece back together to make cobblestone. You can also make a cozy firepit, made by tossing three sticks, plant string, and a log and clicking and holding with a fire starter. These can be used to cook food, and also make easy torches.
