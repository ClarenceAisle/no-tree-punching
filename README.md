# No Tree Punching

This is a minecraft mod meant to add a little more believability to your first few minutes of minecraft play. It also adds the extra challenge that when you break a block with the wrong tool, it takes much longer to mine, and won't drop anything. Two new tools, Knives and Mattocks are added to help deal with this requirement.

Documentation for how to begin a new world can be found in JEI, under the information tab. All recipes and mechanics should be mentioned there.

## Getting Started

When starting a new world, you will want to find yourself some sticks and rocks. Rocks are found lying on the ground, and can be broken with your first. Sticks can be obtained by punching leaves. Slap a rock on top of a stick and voila! You have made a stone knife.

Knives can be used for two main things: They can cut plant material for extra drops (Leaves drop more sticks, and long grass can drop plant fibers). They can also be used to cut items down. To cut an item, hold a knife in one hand and the item to be cut in the other, and then right click.

The first thing you will want to cut is some rocks, do make flint. With sticks, flint, and some plant fibers you can now make a crude axe. Note, due to the crudeness of this axe, when breaking logs it only drops one wooden plank, and maybe some sticks. Once you have wooden planks you can make a crafting table and then get a wooden pickaxe, right?

Wrong. Who ever thought wooden pickaxes were a good idea. Instead, you can use some sticks, flint and plant fibers to make yourself a crude flint pickaxe. This pickaxe is similar to the crude axe in that it will drop pieces of the blocks it mines. For instance, stone and cobblestone will drop rocks, coal ore will drop coal pieces, and iron ore will drop iron pieces. It is the latter you will want to gather. You will need twelve iron ore pieces to craft the three iron ore needed to make a iron pickaxe.

On that note, you will also need to find some coal, because crafting a furnace now requires coal. Once you have that you can now craft yourself an iron pick, elevating yourself from the stone age. You can now get better knives, try out a mattock, and proceed with whatever you normally would do from here.
