This is a minecraft mod meant to add a little more believability to your first few minutes of minecraft play. It was initially inspired by features from TerraFirmaCraft, but has since been refocused around the titular idea:

**Blocks don't drop anything if broken with the incorrect tool.**

In order to cope with this, there are several new features:
 - Rocks are found on the ground and can be picked up without a tool
 - Leaves can be harvested without a tool for sticks
 - Gravel can be mined without a tool, and enables you to acquire flint
 - Flint can be "knapped" on an exposed stone surface, obtaining flint shards.
 - A flint knife can now be crafted, allowing you to harvest plant materials for plant fibers and craft plant string.
 - A flint axe can enable you to collect wood and build a crafting table.
 - A flint pickaxe, hoe, shovel will serve as early game tools, while you can create a macuahuitl for a good early game weapon.

Later on in the game, there are also a couple other additions which fit the stylistic theme of this mod:
 - Vanilla recipes for wooden and stone tools have been removed.
 - The vanilla campfire recipe has been removed, and instead can be created by using a fire starter.
 - Pottery can be created using a clay tool on a block of clay, forming it to shape before firing it in a campfire or a furnace.
 - Knives are a new tool available in all vanilla tool materials, and can be used as weak swords, as a crafting tool, or a plant harvester.
 - Saws are weaker axes which can be used as crafting items, and are essential for converting wood into planks and planks into sticks.
 - Mattocks are the ultimate all-in-one tool. They can mine blocks as if they were a shovel or axe, can strip wood like an axe, till grass like a hoe, and make paths like a shovel. (The latter two functions sometimes conflict and can be chosen by sneaking)
